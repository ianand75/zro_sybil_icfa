# Reasoning

This cluster is funded by an Indirect Common Funder who uses a smart contract to transfer funds to this cluster to obscure the from-to relationship.

- The number of addresses in this cluster is larger than 20.
- Each address is from the snapshot database and not already labeled.
- The funder address is not from a centralized exchange (CEX).

This cluster is highly suspected of being a sybil, as it is funded and controlled by a single entity.
