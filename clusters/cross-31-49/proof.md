# Reasoning

This cluster, funded by **Indirect Common Funder**, employs smart contracts to obscure the from-to relationship of fund transfers. It contains over 20 addresses sourced from the snapshot database, none of which are initially labeled. The funder address originates from a non-CEX source. Notably, batch funding activities on this cluster has been observed across multiple chains, as listed below. These factors strongly suggest the cluster's potential for being a sybil, controlled and financed by a single entity.
